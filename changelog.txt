Version 4.1
=======================
+ License changes - Now there is a Free and PRO version of tinyMediaManager. In the Free version there is no more limitation of loaded movies/TV shows or API calls.
  The Free version includes:
    - base functionality of tinyMediaManager (update data sources, scrape, rename, edit, export, command line interface, ...)
    - TMDB scraper

  The PRO version includes also:
    - all other scrapers (IMDB, OMDB, Universal, Kodi, ...)
    - trailer download
    - subtitle download
    - Trakt.tv integration

+ BIG scraper rework:
  We split up all scrapers into individual sub-scrapers for every scope (meta data, artwork, trailer, subtitle).
  This offers new options to configure them:
    - now they are all independently configurable (no setting for the movie section influences the TV show section)
    - we could strip out options which are not needed for the actual section (e.g. TV show options in the movie scraper)
    - they have a better code base for future changes
  The only drawback here is, that you may have to enter some options (like an individual API key) in every sub-scraper
  ATTENTION: since almost everything changed in the scraper setup, you may need to re-set the scraper options after the update
