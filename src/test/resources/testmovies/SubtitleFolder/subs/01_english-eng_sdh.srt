you're not a businessman after all?

891
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:25,707
Just a man.

892
02:20:28,378 --> 02:20:30,003
An ancient race.

893
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:40,681
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

894
02:20:41,057 --> 02:20:43,016
The future don't matter to us.

895
02:20:43,893 --> 02:20:45,102
Nothing matters now.

896
02:20:45,186 --> 02:20:48,522
Not the land, not the money,
not the woman.

897
02:20:49,148 --> 02:20:51,024
I came here to see you.

898
02:20:53,611 --> 02:20:56,697
'Cause I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

899
02:21:12,005 --> 02:21:14,089
Only at the point of dying.

900
02:21:17,427 --> 02:21:18,635
I know.

901
02:22:03,306 --> 02:22:07,017
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

902
02:22:07,977 --> 02:22:10,103
Put it there, please.

903
02:22:12,523 --> 02:22:16,234
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

904
02:22:22,742 --> 02:22:24,117
You know what?

905
02:22:25,912 --> 02:22:28,580
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

906
02:22:38,216 --> 02:22:39,841
You can't imagine

907
02:22:41,135 --> 02:22:44,304
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

908
02:22:46,766 --> 02:22:48,517
Just to look at her.

909
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:55,482
And if one of them
should pat your behind,

910
02:22:57,527 --> 02:23:00,153
just make believe it's nothing.

911
02:23:03,116 --> 02:23:04,658
They earned it.

912
02:27:38,933 --> 02:27:41,267
Keep your loving brother happy.

913
02:29:14,695 --> 02:29:15,987
(INAUDIBLE)

914
02:31:00,217 --> 02:31:02,635
Who... Who are you?

915
02:32:10,412 --> 02:32:14,249
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

916
02:32:17,378 --> 02:32:19,420
But I'm not the right man.

917
02:32:32,309 --> 02:32:33,977
And neither is he.

918
02:32:36,814 --> 02:32:38,147
Maybe not.

919
02:32:38,732 --> 02:32:40,233
But it doesn't matter.

920
02:32:44,613 --> 02:32:46,739
You don't understand, Jill.

921
02:32:48,284 --> 02:32:51,244
People like that have something inside.

922
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:55,873
Something to do with death.

923
02:32:59,253 --> 02:33:03,423
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

924
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:06,592
pick up his gear and say adis.

925
02:33:12,349 --> 02:33:14,976
It would be nice to see this town grow.

926
02:33:20,024 --> 02:33:21,482
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

927
02:34:47,027 --> 02:34:48,361
Now I gotta go.

928
02:34:48,862 --> 02:34:49,904
(GASPS)

929
02:35:34,658 --> 02:35:38,244
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

930
02:35:42,916 --> 02:35:45,251
I hope you'll come back someday.

931
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:04,270
Someday.

932
02:36:16,658 --> 02:36:20,536
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

933
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:48,523
Make believe it's nothing.

934
02:38:08,645 --> 02:38:09,895
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

935
02:38:54,107 --> 02:38:55,775
Sorry, Harmonica.

936
02:38:56,318 --> 02:38:58,319
I gotta stay here.

937
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:37,983
Who?

938
02:39:41,697 --> 02:39:43,698
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

939
02:39:44,741 --> 02:39:48,160
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

940
02:39:48,995 --> 02:39:51,038
He got scared.

941
02:39:51,123 --> 02:39:52,206
(GROANING)

942
02:40:09,474 --> 02:40:11,016
Hey, Harmonica.

943
02:40:12,519 --> 02:40:14,270
When they do you in,

944
02:40:15,021 --> 02:40:17,523
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

945
02:40:28,618 --> 02:40:29,785
(GROANS)

946
02:40:33,373 --> 02:40:34,498
Go away.

947
02:40:37,544 --> 02:40:38,794
Go away.

948
02:40:39,504 --> 02:40:42,548
Go away. I don't want you to see me die.

949
02:41:03,945 --> 02:41:04,945
(GROANS)

950
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:17,708
(SOFT THUD)

951
02:41:34,392 --> 02:41:35,810
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

02:43:43,647 --> 02:43:44,897
